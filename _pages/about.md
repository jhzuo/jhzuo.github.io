My research strives to develop efficient, scalable, and trustworthy machine learning algorithms to build intelligent, learning-enabled networks and systems. To achieve this, I use theoretical tools from machine learning, optimization, and probability to design new algorithms with theoretical guarantees. These algorithms have been successfully deployed in data networks, edge/mobile/cloud computing systems, social networks, and beyond.

I will be joining the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk) as a tenure-track assistant professor in Fall 2024. 

<span style="color: red;">Openings:</span> I am seeking PhD students, research assistants, and postdocs starting in Spring 2025 or Fall 2025. For more detailed information, please refer to this [page](https://jhzuo.github.io/openings/). If you are interested, please email me your CV and transcripts.


Bio
======
I am a joint postdoc at [Caltech CMS](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) and [UMass Amherst CICS](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), working with Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and Prof. [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/). I recevied my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022. I was a member of the [LIONS](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/index.html) research group advised by Prof. [Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/). Before that, I received my B.E. in Communication Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2017.

My CV can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SYAuP3JsD7LUFYkGSaZVcpL7Za5O7AYH/view?usp=sharing).
