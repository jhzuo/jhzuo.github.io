My research focuses on online learning and sequential decision-making for building efficient, scalable, and trustworthy machine learning systems. I study both system-driven problems in learning theory and theory-guided algorithms for real-world systems, including LLM serving, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and edge AI. A central theme of my work is bridging learning theory with system design to enable intelligent, resource-aware computation.

<span style="color: purple;">**Openings**:</span> I am seeking self-motivated PhD/MPhil students starting in Fall 2026 and Research Assistants starting in Summer 2026.  If you are interested, please email me your CV and transcripts. For more information, please visit this [page](https://jhzuo.github.io/openings/).

Bio
======
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk). Prior to this, I was a joint postdoc at University of Massachusetts Amherst and California Institute of Technology. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, after completing a B.E in Communication Engineering at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
