I am a joint postdoc at Caltech and UMass Amherst, co-advised by [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Prof. Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/). I recevied my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022. I was a member of the [LIONS](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/index.html) research group advised by [Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/). Before joining CMU, I received a B.E. in Communication Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2017.

Research
======
My main research interests include online learning, resource allocation, and network systems. I am particularly interested in online learning for large-scale network systems with numerous learning parameters and large action spaces. My research work aims at developing rigorous algorithms with provable learning efficiency for applications in various domains such as edge computing, wireless networking, social networks, and cyber-physical systems. My recent works study large-scale online learning problems from different perspectives, including combinatorial bandits with side information, multi-agent cooperative learning, and learning-augmented online algorithms with predictions. I am also interested in trustworthy online learning including adversarial attacks on bandits and robust online algorithm design against corruptions.
