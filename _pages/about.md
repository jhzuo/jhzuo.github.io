My research strives to develop efficient, scalable, and trustworthy machine learning algorithms to build intelligent, learning-enabled networks and systems. To achieve this, I use theoretical tools from machine learning, optimization, and probability to design rigorous algorithms with theoretical guarantees. These algorithms have been deployed in data networks, edge/mobile/cloud computing systems, recommender systems, and beyond.

<span style="color: purple;">**Openings**:</span> I am seeking PhD students and Research Assistants starting in Spring 2025 or Fall 2025.  If you are interested, please email me your CV and transcripts. For more information, please visit this [page](https://jhzuo.github.io/openings/).

Bio
======
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk). Prior to this, I was a joint postdoc at Caltech and UMass Amherst, working with Prof. Adam Wierman and Prof. Mohammad Hajiesmaili. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022, advised by Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong. Before that, I completed my B.E. in Communication Engineering at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2017.
