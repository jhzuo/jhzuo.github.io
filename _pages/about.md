My research focuses on online learning and sequential decision-making for building efficient, scalable, and trustworthy machine learning systems. I study both system-driven problems in learning theory and theory-guided algorithms for real-world systems, including LLM serving, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and edge AI. A central theme of my work is bridging learning theory with system design to enable intelligent, resource-aware computation.

<span style="color: purple;">**Openings**:</span> I am seeking PhD students starting in Fall 2026 and Research Assistants starting in Spring 2026.  If you are interested, please email me your CV and transcripts. For more information, please visit this [page](https://jhzuo.github.io/openings/).

Bio
======
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk). Prior to this, I was a joint postdoc at University of Massachusetts Amherst and California Institute of Technology. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, following a B.E. in Communication Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
