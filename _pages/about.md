I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a member of the [Learning, Incentives, and Optimization for Networked Systems (LIONS)](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/index.html) research group and my advisor is [Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/). My research interests include online learning, social networks, and wireless networking.

Before joining CMU, I received a B.E. in Communication Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2017.
