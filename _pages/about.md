My research strives to develop **efficient**, **scalable** and **trustworthy** machine learning algorithms to build intelligent networked systems. Towards this goal, I  use theoretical tools from machine learning, optimization, and probablity, to design rigorous algorithms with provable guarantees that have been deployed in data networks, edge/mobile/cloud computing systems, social networks, and beyond.

**I am in the 2023-2024 job market looking for faculty positions**. My CV can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SYAuP3JsD7LUFYkGSaZVcpL7Za5O7AYH/view?usp=sharing).

<!-- My recent works study online learning for networked systems from different perspectives, including online resource allocation under collaboration and competition, variance-adaptive combinatorial bandits, and online learning with side information. I am also actively exploring trustworthy online learning, particularly involving adversarial attacks on bandits and robust online algorithms against corruptions. -->


Bio
======
I am a joint postdoc at Caltech and UMass Amherst, working with Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and Prof. [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/). I recevied my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022. I was a member of the [LIONS](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/index.html) research group advised by Prof. [Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/). Before that, I received my B.E. in Communication Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2017.
