My research focuses on online learning and sequential decision-making for building efficient, scalable, and trustworthy machine learning systems. I work on both system-driven learning theory problems and theory-guided online algorithms for real-world systems, including LLM serving, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and edge AI. A central theme of my work is integrating learning theory with system design to enable intelligent, resource-aware computation.

<span style="color: purple;">**Openings**:</span> I am seeking Research Assistants starting in Summer/Fall 2025 and PhD students starting in Fall 2026.  If you are interested, please email me your CV and transcripts. For more information, please visit this [page](https://jhzuo.github.io/openings/).

Bio
======
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk). Prior to this, I was a joint postdoc at California Institute of Technology and University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with Prof. Adam Wierman and Prof. Mohammad Hajiesmaili. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong. Before that, I completed my B.E. in Communication Engineering at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
